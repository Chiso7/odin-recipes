    <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>

    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
    <li>Grill pineapple rings until heated through and grill marks appear, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
